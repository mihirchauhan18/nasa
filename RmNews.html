    <h2>Hubble Sees Evaporating Planet Getting the Hiccups</h2>
    <div class="part-1">

        <div class="contetntText">
            <p>A young planet whirling around a petulant red dwarf star is changing in unpredictable ways
                orbit-by-orbit. It is so close to its parent star that it experiences a consistent, torrential
                blast of energy, which evaporates its hydrogen atmosphere â€“ causing it to puff off the
                planet.<br><br>

                But during one orbit observed with NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, the planet looked like it
                wasn't losing any material at all, while an orbit observed with Hubble a year and a half later
                showed clear signs of atmospheric loss.<br><br>

                This extreme variability between orbits shocked astronomers. "We've never seen atmospheric
                escape go from completely not detectable to very detectable over such a short period when a
                planet passes in front of its star," said Keighley Rockcliffe of Dartmouth College in Hanover,
                New Hampshire. "We were really expecting something very predictable, repeatable. But it turned
                out to be weird. When I first saw this, I thought 'That can't be right.'"<br><br>

                Rockcliffe was equally puzzled to see, when it was detectable, the planet's atmosphere puffing
                out in front of the planet, like a headlight on a fast-bound train. "This frankly strange
                observation is kind of a stress-test case for the modeling and the physics about planetary
                evolution. This observation is so cool because we're getting to probe this interplay between the
                star and the planet that is really at the most extreme," she said.

    <h2>STScI Awarded Multi-Year Contract Extension for Roman Space Telescope</h2>
    <div class="part-2">
        <div class="News-Img">
            <img src="./img/news/1.jpg" alt="News" title="News">
        </div>
        <div class="contetntText">
            <p>NASA has awarded a contract extension to the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in
                Baltimore, Maryland, to continue acting as the Science Operations Center (SOC) for NASAâ€™s Nancy
                Grace Roman Space Telescope. The extension covers the period through launch, commissioning, and
                the first year of operations.<br><br>

                Roman is a NASA observatory that will study essential questions in a wide range of astrophysics
                topics, such as the evolution of stars, planets, and galaxies, in addition to probing dark
                energy and detecting thousands of new planets outside our solar system. With a launch commitment
                no later than May 2027, and launch currently planned for late 2026, Roman will have a five-year
                prime mission.<br><br>

                Roman is primarily a survey observatory, with some additional observations set aside to
                demonstrate the technology of a next-generation coronagraph instrument. Romanâ€™s surveys are
                designed to address a number of key science themes. Up to 75% of its observing time during the
                first five years of operations will be dedicated to three core community surveys: the
                High-Latitude Wide-Area Survey, the High-Latitude Time Domain Survey, and the Galactic Bulge
                Time Domain Survey. Additional observing time is set aside for general astrophysics surveys that
                will be selected throughout the course of the observatoryâ€™s operations. Observing time will be
                made available to the astronomical community via a proposal process like that used to assign
                time on the Hubble and James Webb Space Telescopes.

    <h2>Hubble Celebrates 33rd Anniversary with a Peek into Nearby Star-Forming Region</h2>
    <div class="part-3">
        <div class="News-Img">
            <img src="./img/news/2.jpg" alt="News" title="News">

        <div class="contetntText">
            <p>Astronomers are celebrating NASA's Hubble Space Telescope's 33rd launch anniversary with an
                ethereal photo of a nearby star-forming region, NGC 1333. The nebula is in the Perseus molecular
                cloud, and located approximately 960 light-years away.<br><br>

                Hubble's colorful view, showcased through its unique capability to obtain images from
                ultraviolet to near-infrared light, unveils an effervescent cauldron of glowing gasses and
                pitch-black dust stirred up and blown around by several hundred newly forming stars embedded
                within the dark cloud. Hubble just scratches the surface because most of the star birthing
                firestorm is hidden behind clouds of fine dust â€“ essentially soot â€“ that are thicker toward the
                bottom of the image. The blackness in the image is not empty space, but filled with obscuring
                dust.<br><br>

                To capture this image, Hubble peered through a veil of dust on the edge of a giant cloud of cold
                molecular hydrogen â€“ the raw material for fabricating new stars and planets under the relentless
                pull of gravity. The image underscores the fact that star formation is a messy process in our
                rambunctious universe.<br><br>

                Ferocious stellar winds, likely from the bright blue star at the top of the image, are blowing
                through a curtain of dust. The fine dust scatters the starlight at blue wavelengths.

            <p>There's an invisible monster on the loose, barreling through intergalactic space so fast that if
                it were in our solar system, it could travel from Earth to the Moon in 14 minutes. This
                supermassive black hole, weighing as much as 20 million Suns, has left behind a
                never-before-seen 200,000-light-year-long "contrail" of newborn stars, twice the diameter of our
                Milky Way galaxy. It's likely the result of a rare, bizarre game of galactic billiards among
                three massive black holes.<br><br>

                Rather than gobbling up stars ahead of it, like a cosmic Pac-Man, the speedy black hole is
                plowing into gas in front of it to trigger new star formation along a narrow corridor. The black
                hole is streaking too fast to take time for a snack. Nothing like it has ever been seen before,
                but it was captured accidentally by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope.<br><br>

                "We think we're seeing a wake behind the black hole where the gas cools and is able to form
                stars. So, we're looking at star formation trailing the black hole," said Pieter van Dokkum of
                Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. "What we're seeing is the aftermath. Like the wake
                behind a ship we're seeing the wake behind the black hole." The trail must have lots of new
                stars, given that it is almost half as bright as the host galaxy it is linked to.<br><br>

                The black hole lies at one end of the column, which stretches back to its parent galaxy. There
                is a remarkably bright knot of ionized oxygen at the outermost tip of the column. Researchers
                believe gas is probably being shocked and heated from the motion of the black hole hitting the
                gas, or it could be radiation from an accretion disk around the black hole. "Gas in front of it
                gets shocked because of this supersonic, very high-velocity impact of the black hole moving
                through the gas. How it works exactly is not really known," said van Dokkum.

    <h2>Giant Galaxy Seen in 3D by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and Keck Observatory</h2>

            <p>Though we live in a vast three-dimensional universe, celestial objects seen through a telescope
                look flat because everything is so far away. Now for the first time, astronomers have measured
                the three-dimensional shape of one of the biggest and closest elliptical galaxies to us, M87.
                This galaxy turns out to be "triaxial," or potato-shaped. This stereo vision was made possible
                by combining the power of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and the ground-based W. M. Keck
                Observatory on Maunakea, Hawaii.<br><br>

                In most cases, astronomers must use their intuition to figure out the true shapes of deep-space
                objects. For example, the whole class of huge galaxies called "ellipticals" look like blobs in
                pictures. Determining the true shape of giant elliptical galaxies will help astronomers
                understand better how large galaxies and their central large black holes form.<br><br>

                Scientists made the 3D plot by measuring the motions of stars that swarm around the galaxy's
                supermassive central black hole. The stellar motion was used to provide new insights into the
                shape of the galaxy and its rotation, and it also yielded a new measurement of the black hole's
                mass. Tracking the stellar speeds and position allowed researchers to build a three-dimensional
                view of the galaxy.<br><br>

                Astronomers at the University of California, Berkeley, were able to determine the mass of the
                black hole at the galaxy's core to a high precision, estimating it at 5.4 billion times the mass
                of the Sun. Hubble observations in 1995 first measured the M87 black hole as being 2.4 billion
                solar masses, which astronomers deduced by clocking the speed of the gas swirling around the
                black hole. When the Event Horizon Telescope, an international collaboration of ground-based
                telescopes, released the first-ever image of the same black hole in 2019, the size of its
                pitch-black event horizon allowed researchers to calculate a mass of 6.5 billion solar masses
                using Einstein's theory of general relativity.

    <h2>NASA's Hubble Hunts for Intermediate-Sized Black Hole Close to Home</h2>

            <p>Astronomers using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope have come up with what they say is some of their
                best evidence yet for the presence of a rare class of "intermediate-sized" black hole that may
                be lurking in the heart of the closest globular star cluster to Earth, located 6,000 light-years
                away.<br><br>

                Like intense gravitational potholes in the fabric of space, virtually all black holes seem to
                come in two sizes: small and humongous. It's estimated that our galaxy is littered with 100
                million small black holes (several times the mass of our Sun) created from exploded stars. The
                universe at large is flooded with supermassive black holes, weighing millions or billions of
                times our Sunâ€™s mass and found in the centers of galaxies.<br><br>

                A long-sought missing link is an intermediate-mass black hole, weighing in somewhere between 100
                and 100,000 solar masses. How would they form, where would they hang out, and why do they seem
                to be so rare?<br><br>

                Astronomers have identified other possible intermediate-mass black holes through a variety of
                observational techniques. Two of the best candidates â€” 3XMM J215022.4âˆ’055108, which Hubble
                helped discover in 2020, and HLX-1, identified in 2009 â€” reside in dense star clusters in the
                outskirts of other galaxies. Each of these possible black holes has the mass of tens of
                thousands of suns, and may have once been at the centers of dwarf galaxies. NASAâ€™s Chandra X-ray
                observatory has also helped make many possible intermediate black hole discoveries, including a
                large sample in 2018.<br><br>

                Looking much closer to home, there have been a number of suspected intermediate-mass black holes
                detected in dense globular star clusters orbiting our Milky Way galaxy. For example, in 2008, Hubble
                astronomers announced the suspected presence of an intermediate-mass black hole in the globular cluster
                Omega Centauri. For a number of reasons, including the need for more data, these and other
                intermediate-mass black hole findings still remain inconclusive and do not rule out alternative
                theories.

    <h2>Hubble Follows Shadow Play Around Planet-Forming Disk</h2>

            <p>The young star TW Hydrae is playing "shadow puppets" with scientists observing it with NASA's
                Hubble Space Telescope.<br><br>

                In 2017, astronomers reported discovering a shadow sweeping across the face of a vast
                pancake-shaped gas-and-dust disk surrounding the red dwarf star. The shadow isn't from a planet,
                but from an inner disk slightly inclined relative to the much larger outer disk â€“ causing it to
                cast a shadow. One explanation is that an unseen planet's gravity is pulling dust and gas into
                the planet's inclined orbit.<br><br>

                Now, a second shadow â€“ playing a game of peek-a-boo â€“ has emerged in just a few years between
                observations stored in Hubble's MAST archive. This could be from yet another disk nestled inside
                the system. The two disks are likely evidence of a pair of planets under construction.<br><br>

                TW Hydrae is less than 10 million years old and resides about 200 light-years away. In its
                infancy, our solar system may have resembled the TW Hydrae system, some 4.6 billion years ago.
                Because the TW Hydrae system is tilted nearly face-on to our view from Earth, it is an optimum
                target for getting a bull's-eye-view of a planetary construction yard.

    <h2>Hubble Unexpectedly Finds Double Quasar in Distant Universe</h2>
    <div class="part-8">
        <div class="News-Img">

        <div class="contetntText">
            <p>The early universe was a rambunctious place where galaxies often bumped into each other and even
                merged together. Using NASA's Hubble Space Telescope and other space and ground-based
                observatories, astronomers investigating these developments have made an unexpected and rare
                discovery: a pair of gravitationally bound quasars, both blazing away inside two merging
                galaxies. They existed when the universe was just 3 billion years old.<br><br>

                Quasars are bright objects powered by voracious, supermassive black holes blasting out ferocious
                fountains of energy as they engorge themselves on gas, dust, and anything else within their
                gravitational grasp.<br><br>

                "We don't see a lot of double quasars at this early time in the universe. And that's why this
                discovery is so exciting," said graduate student Yu-Ching Chen of the University of Illinois at
                Urbana-Champaign, lead author of this study.<br><br>

                Finding close binary quasars is a relatively new area of research that has just developed in the
                past 10 to 15 years. Today's powerful new observatories have allowed astronomers to identify
                instances where two quasars are active at the same time and are close enough that they will
                eventually merge.<br><br>

                There is increasing evidence that large galaxies are built up through mergers. Smaller systems come
                together to form bigger systems and ever larger structures. During that process there should be pairs of
                supermassive black holes formed within the merging galaxies. "Knowing about the progenitor population of
                black holes will eventually tell us about the emergence of supermassive black holes in the early
                universe, and how frequent those mergers could be," said Chen.<br><br>

                "We're starting to unveil this tip of the iceberg of the early binary quasar population," said Xin Liu
                of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. "This is the uniqueness of this study. It is actually
                telling us that this population exists, and now we have a method to identify double quasars that are
                separated by less than the size of a single galaxy."<br><br>

                This was a needle-in-haystack search that required the combined power of NASA's Hubble Space Telescope
                and the W.M. Keck Observatories in Hawaii. Multi-wavelength observations from the International Gemini
                Observatory in Hawaii, NSF's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array in New Mexico, and NASA's Chandra X-ray
                Observatory also contributed to understanding the dynamic duo. And, ESA (European Space Agency)'s Gaia
                space observatory helped identify this double quasar in the first place.<br><br>

                "Hubble's sensitivity and resolution provided pictures that allow us to rule out other possibilities for
                what we are seeing," said Chen. Hubble shows, unequivocally, that this is indeed a genuine pair of
                supermassive black holes, rather than two images of the same quasar created by a foreground
                gravitational lens. And, Hubble shows a tidal feature from the merging of two galaxies, where gravity
                distorts the shape of the galaxies forming two tails of stars.<br><br>
